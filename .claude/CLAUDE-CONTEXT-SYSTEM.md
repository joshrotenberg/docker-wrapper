# Claude Context System: Complete Setup & Guide

**A self-contained, AI-managed system for maintaining project context and architectural decisions. You focus on coding, your AI assistant handles the rest.**

## üöÄ AI Assistant Quick Start & Guidelines

**If you're an AI assistant getting oriented on this project for the first time, follow this sequence:**

### 0. Essential Checklist (Always Start Here)
- [ ] Verify current date is correct (update if wrong)
- [ ] Read entire context before taking action
- [ ] Check for SESSION-CONTEXT.md (single point of entry)
- [ ] Review ADR index for architectural decisions
- [ ] Maintain consistency with existing choices

### 1. Session Orientation Sequence
1. **Check for SESSION-CONTEXT.md**: If present, start here for current status and immediate next actions
2. **Read ADR Index**: `.claude/adr-index.toml` - shows current decisions and project metadata
3. **Review Recent ADRs**: Look in `.claude/branches/` for latest architectural decisions
4. **Understand Permissions**: Check `.claude/adr-index.toml` configuration for allowed operations
5. **Current Branch Structure**: Use `git branch -a` to see active development

### 2. Session Maintenance (Do This Throughout)
- [ ] Update SESSION-CONTEXT.md after completing significant tasks
- [ ] Document new architectural decisions as ADRs
- [ ] Keep context files current and accurate
- [ ] Check for system updates periodically

### 3. Session Handoff (Before Ending)
- [ ] Update SESSION-CONTEXT.md with current status
- [ ] Note any pending decisions or next actions
- [ ] Ensure all work is properly documented
- [ ] Update today's goals completion status

### 4. Key Files for Context
- **`SESSION-CONTEXT.md`** - Daily working context (if present)
- **`.claude/adr-index.toml`** - Project metadata, permissions, active ADRs
- **`.claude/branches/*/`** - All architectural decisions organized by type
- **`README.md`** - Public-facing overview and quick start
- **This file** - Complete system specification and setup guide

**Quick Command**: To see all recent decisions: `find .claude/branches -name "*.md" -exec basename {} \; | sort`

## üéØ The Promise: AI Does the Work, You Stay Focused

**For Developers:**
- Write code and make decisions normally
- Your AI assistant automatically tracks everything
- Never lose context between sessions
- Skip documentation busywork

**For AI Assistants:**
- Complete project context in every session
- Architectural decision history and reasoning
- Current work status and priorities
- Permission-aware automation

**For Teams:**
- Shared understanding across all sessions
- Safe collaboration without workflow disruption
- Decision traceability without overhead

## üìã Session Management Pattern (Recommended)

For projects with frequent AI assistant sessions or team handoffs, the **Single Point of Entry** pattern eliminates context confusion and improves session continuity.

### When to Use This Pattern
- Multiple AI sessions per day
- Team collaboration with context handoffs
- Long-running projects with evolving context
- Need for quick session orientation

### Implementation

**Create `SESSION-CONTEXT.md` as your daily working file:**

```
.claude/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SESSION-CONTEXT.md          # ‚Üê Single point of entry
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CLAUDE-CONTEXT-SYSTEM.md    # System setup and reference
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ adr-index.toml              # ADR index
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ adr-helper.sh               # Management scripts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ arch/                       # ADRs when needed
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/                       # Supporting documentation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ archive/                    # Historical context
```

### Benefits of This Pattern
- **No confusion about where to start** - One clear entry point
- **Essential info without overwhelming detail** - Focused on current needs
- **Easy session handoff and continuation** - Clear status and next actions
- **Only one file needs regular updates** - Reduces maintenance overhead
- **Historical preservation** - Archive keeps long-term context separate

### Integration with Existing System
- SESSION-CONTEXT.md complements, doesn't replace, the core ADR system
- ADRs remain the authoritative source for architectural decisions
- Supporting documentation stays organized in subdirectories
- All existing workflows continue unchanged

## The Problem This Solves (2-Minute Pitch)

### The Problem We're Solving

- **"Why did we choose X?"** - Asked 6 months later, nobody remembers
- **"What did the last person try?"** - Context lost when team members change
- **"What should our AI assistant know?"** - Inconsistent recommendations across sessions
- **"Where did we leave off?"** - AI agents lose context between sessions, leading to repeated mistakes
- **"Will this break my team's workflow?"** - Non-users shouldn't be hindered by the system
- **"Can I trust it with git operations?"** - Unauthorized automation can be disruptive
- **Technical debt from undocumented decisions** - Costs compound over time

### The Solution: Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

A lightweight system that:
- Takes 5 minutes to set up
- Requires ~10 minutes per major decision
- Saves hours of confusion and rework
- Makes AI assistants 10x more helpful
- **Works safely in shared repositories** without disrupting non-users
- **Asks permission** before any git/GitHub operations
- **Detects external changes** and suggests relevant ADRs

### Real ROI Example

**Without ADRs:** 2 hours finding why Redis was chosen over Postgres **With ADRs:** 2 minutes reading `cache-technology-decision.md` **Break-even:** After just 3-4 "why did we..." questions

## Quick Setup (Copy ‚Üí Paste ‚Üí Done)

### 1. Create the Directory Structure

```
mkdir -p .claude/{branches/{feat,docs,chore,arch},merged,templates}
```

### 2. Copy This File

Save this file as `.claude/CLAUDE-CONTEXT-SYSTEM.md` in your project root.

### 3. Tell Claude

"Please read `.claude/CLAUDE-CONTEXT-SYSTEM.md` and set up the complete system. Also create a SESSION-CONTEXT.md file using the template for daily context management."

**Alternative for basic setup without session management:**
"Please read `.claude/CLAUDE-CONTEXT-SYSTEM.md` and set up the complete system."

That's it! Claude will create all the files, templates, and scripts needed.

### 4. Set Up Update Checking (Recommended)

Add a reminder to check for system updates:

```
"Remind me to check the canonical Claude Context System repository 
(https://github.com/joshrotenberg/claude-context-system) 
for updates next month and implement any improvements."
```

## Minimal Usage Example

Want to see how simple this really is? Here's the absolute minimum:

1. Create: `mkdir -p .claude`
2. Save this file as `.claude/CLAUDE-CONTEXT-SYSTEM.md`
3. Tell your AI: "Set up the Claude Context System"
4. Make a decision: "We're using PostgreSQL for our database"
5. AI creates the ADR automatically - you keep coding

That's it. No configuration, no learning curve, just natural conversation with your AI assistant.

## üöÄ You're Looking at an AI-First System

**IMPORTANT: This document looks comprehensive because your AI assistant manages all of it.** You don't need to learn or maintain any of this manually.

### How It Actually Works:
1. **You:** "Let's use PostgreSQL instead of Redis for caching"
2. **AI:** Creates ADR, updates context, tracks implementation  
3. **You:** Keep coding while AI handles documentation

### Three Weeks Later:
1. **You:** "Why did we choose PostgreSQL for caching?"
2. **AI:** "ADR #7 from Jan 15th: Redis caused memory issues in production, PostgreSQL provides ACID guarantees we needed for transaction caching"
3. **You:** Get answer instantly, keep working

### The Files Are Human-Readable But AI-Managed
- **Markdown/TOML** format so you CAN read them
- **AI assistant** maintains them so you DON'T HAVE TO
- **Git-friendly** so teams can collaborate
- **Zero external dependencies** so it works everywhere

**The rest of this document is your AI assistant's manual, not yours.**

### Works with Any AI Assistant
While designed with Claude in mind, this system works equally well with GPT-4, Gemini, or any AI that can read markdown and TOML files. Simply provide your AI assistant with the `.claude/CLAUDE-CONTEXT-SYSTEM.md` file and it will understand how to manage your project's context.

## Why This Actually Works (For Skeptical Developers)

**No Magic, Just Text Files**
- Everything is markdown and TOML - you can `cat`, `grep`, and `vim` all of it
- Git tracks everything - full history, diffs, and blame like any other code
- Zero vendor lock-in - take your decisions anywhere

**It Works Because It's Lazy**
- You're already making decisions - this just captures them
- You're already talking to AI - this just adds "btw, document this"
- You're already using git - this just adds meaningful files to track

**The Genius is in What's Missing**
- No database to corrupt
- No service to fail  
- No API to break
- No format to migrate
- No tool to learn

**Proof It Works**: You're reading this in a markdown file that your AI will parse, understand, and execute. If this document works, the system works.

## Built on Proven Foundations

This system combines two foundational practices in modern software development:

### ü§ù Conventional Commits + Architectural Decision Records

**Conventional Commits** - A specification for standardized commit messages that enable automated tooling and clear communication. Created by the open-source community and inspired by Angular's commit guidelines, it provides structure for `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:` and other commit types.

**Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)** - Introduced by Michael Nygard in 2011, ADRs capture the context, decision, and consequences of architecturally significant choices. They solve the "why did we choose X?" problem that plagues every software project.

### üöÄ Our Innovation: Unified Context System

We've merged these practices into something new:
- **Conventional commit structure** for ADR organization and workflow
- **ADR decision tracking** with modern git-native tooling
- **AI assistant integration** that understands both commit history and decision context
- **Self-contained system** that requires no external dependencies
- **üîê Tiered authorization system** for safe git/GitHub operations
- **üë• Multi-developer repository support** with passive monitoring
- **üîç Smart change detection** that suggests ADRs for external decisions

This creates a decision management system that's both lightweight and powerful - perfect for teams using AI assistants in their development workflow.

**Credits**: Huge thanks to Michael Nygard for ADRs and the Conventional Commits community for commit standardization. This system builds on their foundational work.

## üóìÔ∏è CRITICAL: AI Assistant Date Awareness

**AI Assistant: ALWAYS start every session with:**

1. **Check current date first** - Never assume dates
2. Read `.claude/adr-index.toml` [updates] section  
3. Compare current date with `next_due_*` fields
4. Alert user to any overdue maintenance
5. Provide context update if due

**Never assume dates - always check current date first!**

## Document Types and Organization

### Conventional Branching Support

The system supports both **simple** and **component-based** ADR organization to match your team's conventional commit and branching patterns:

**Simple Pattern:**
```bash
./adr-helper.sh new feat "user-authentication"
# Creates: .claude/branches/feat/user-authentication.md
```

**Component Pattern (matches conventional commits):**
```bash
./adr-helper.sh new feat/auth "oauth-integration"
# Creates: .claude/branches/feat/auth/oauth-integration.md

./adr-helper.sh new "chore(docs)" "readme-update"  
# Creates: .claude/branches/chore/docs/readme-update.md
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ **Team Alignment**: Matches existing conventional commit/branch workflows
- ‚úÖ **Better Organization**: Component-level grouping within decision types
- ‚úÖ **Backward Compatible**: Existing simple pattern continues to work
- ‚úÖ **Flexible Adoption**: Teams choose their preferred convention style

### Core ADR System (Root Level)
- `CLAUDE-CONTEXT-SYSTEM.md` - Complete system guide and setup
- `adr-index.toml` - Machine-readable decision index
- `adr-helper.sh` - Management and automation scripts
- `branches/` - Active architectural decisions by category
- `merged/` - Completed/archived decisions
- `templates/` - ADR and document templates

### Supporting Documentation (`docs/` Subdirectory)
- `project-context.md` - Project-specific context and overview
- Language-specific guides (e.g., `RUST-PROJECT-SETUP.md`)
- AI context management patterns
- Team-specific documentation
- Reference materials and guides

### Scaling File Organization

As projects grow beyond initial ADR tracking, organize supporting files to keep the root `.claude/` directory clean and navigable.

**Recommended Structure for Growing Projects:**

```
.claude/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SESSION-CONTEXT.md          # Single point of entry (optional)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                   # System usage guide for your project
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CLAUDE-CONTEXT-SYSTEM.md    # This system file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ adr-index.toml              # ADR index
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ adr-helper.sh               # Management scripts
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ arch/                       # Architecture ADRs
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ database-choice.md
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ microservices-approach.md
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ deployment-strategy.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docs/                       # Supporting documentation
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ project-context.md      # Project background and goals
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api-guidelines.md       # Development standards
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ deployment-guide.md     # Operational documentation
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ team-processes.md       # Workflow documentation
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ archive/                    # Historical context
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ old-decisions/          # Superseded ADRs
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ meeting-notes/          # Historical discussions
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ session-history/        # Old SESSION-CONTEXT.md files
```

**Organization Guidelines:**
- **Keep root clean**: Only essential working files at root level
- **Use subdirectories**: Group related documentation logically
- **Archive old content**: Move historical content to `archive/` monthly
- **Single source of truth**: Avoid duplicating information across files
- **Clear naming**: Use descriptive names that indicate content purpose

**Migration Strategy:**
1. **Start simple**: Begin with basic structure, add subdirectories as needed
2. **Move gradually**: Relocate files when they're no longer actively referenced
3. **Update links**: Ensure SESSION-CONTEXT.md and ADRs point to new locations
4. **Archive regularly**: Monthly cleanup prevents accumulation of stale content

### How to Handle Different Document Types

**When to Create ADRs** (in `branches/`):
- **Technology choices**: Why Rust over Go? Why Postgres over MongoDB?
- **Architecture decisions**: Microservices vs monolith? Event-driven vs REST?
- **Process changes**: New deployment strategy, testing approach
- **Requirements specifications**: Major feature requirements and constraints
- **Any decision that's hard to reverse or has broad impact**

**When to Create Supporting Docs** (in `docs/`):
- **Project context**: Current state, goals, and background
- **Setup guides**: Language-specific or tool-specific guidance
- **Process documentation**: Workflows, standards, and procedures
- **Reference materials**: Links, resources, and background information
- **Team knowledge**: Onboarding docs, tribal knowledge, and context

## ADR Template

```
# ADR: [Decision Title]

**Status**: Proposed | Accepted | Superseded
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Author**: Team/Person
**Tags**: [tag1, tag2, tag3]

## Context
What situation are we addressing? What forces are at play?

## Decision
What are we doing? What specific choice are we making?

## Consequences
What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change?

## Alternatives Considered
What other options did we evaluate? Why did we reject them?

## References
Links to relevant discussions, RFCs, documentation
```

# Claude Context Documentation

This directory contains specialized documentation that supports the ADR system but isn't part of the core decision tracking workflow.

## Document Types

### Project Context
- `project-context.md` - Current project state and overview

### Guides & References
- `RUST-PROJECT-SETUP.md` - Rust-specific development guidance
- `context-management-prompt.md` - AI context management patterns

## Usage

These documents provide background context and guidance but aren't part of the formal ADR decision tracking in `../branches/` and `../merged/`.

For active architectural decisions, see:
- `../adr-index.toml` - Master index
- `../branches/` - Active decisions
- `../merged/` - Completed decisions

## AI Assistant Integration

### For Claude/AI Assistants

When working with this project:
- **Always read the ADR index first** to understand current decisions and authorization settings
- **Check permission settings** before suggesting git/GitHub operations
- **Respect authorization levels** - never override user permission preferences
- **Reference specific ADRs** when making recommendations
- **Suggest new ADRs** when major decisions are needed
- **Update ADRs** when decisions change or evolve
- **Maintain consistency** with existing architectural choices
- **Check for system updates** when explicitly asked or monthly
- **Use team features** like `scan` and `suggest` to detect external changes
- **Respect passive mode** in multi-developer environments

### Authorization Guidelines for AI Assistants

**Before any git/GitHub operation:**
1. Check the `[permissions]` section in `adr-index.toml`
2. For "never" - inform user the operation is disabled
3. For "ask" - request explicit permission from user
4. For "yes" - proceed but inform user what you're doing

**Example permission check:**
```
I see you want me to commit these ADR changes. 
Your current setting is 'use_git = "ask"'.
May I proceed with: git add .claude/branches/feat/new-feature.md && git commit -m "Add feature ADR"?
```

### System Update Protocol

When asked to check for updates:
1. Check user's authorization for git operations first
2. Fetch the canonical repository: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/joshrotenberg/claude-context-system/main/CLAUDE-CONTEXT-SYSTEM.md
3. Compare with local `.claude/CLAUDE-CONTEXT-SYSTEM.md`
4. Identify new features, improvements, or fixes
5. Present summary of changes with benefits/impact
6. Ask user which updates to implement
7. Update local system accordingly (respecting permissions)
8. Update "Last local update" date in this file

### Starting a New AI Session

```
Starting session for [project]. Please:

1. **Check current date first** (what is today's date?)
2. Read .claude/adr-index.toml [updates] section  
3. Compare current date with next_due_* fields
4. Show me any overdue maintenance:
   - System updates overdue?
   - Permission review overdue? 
   - ADR maintenance overdue?
   - Context update overdue?
5. If context update is due/overdue, give me current project status
6. Update last_check_* dates for completed items

Authorization level: [check my permissions for git/GitHub operations]
Team environment: [check if passive_mode is enabled]

Then let's start today's work with current context.
Current focus: [specific area/feature]
Open questions: [list any pending decisions]

If this is a team repository, please run './adr-helper.sh scan' to check for external changes.
```

### Enhanced AI Commands

**Permission-aware operations:**
- `"Check my authorization settings and suggest any changes"`
- `"Scan for external changes in team repository"`
- `"Suggest ADRs based on recent commit patterns"`
- `"Enable safe mode for this repository"`

**Team collaboration:**
- `"Set up this repository for team use"`
- `"Check what changes others have made"`
- `"Suggest ADRs for decisions I might have missed"`

## üîê Authorization & üë• Collaboration Features

### Authorization Framework

The enhanced Claude Context System includes a comprehensive permission system to ensure safe operation in any environment:

#### Permission Levels
- **`never`** - Operation is completely disabled
- **`ask`** - Request permission each time (safest for shared environments)
- **`yes`** - Auto-approve operation (convenient for personal projects)

#### Key Authorization Categories

**Git Operations:**
```toml
[permissions]
use_git = "ask"          # Basic git command permission
auto_commit = "no"       # Automatic commits
auto_push = "no"         # Automatic pushes
```

**GitHub/GitLab Operations:**
```toml
[permissions]
use_gh = "ask"           # GitHub CLI operations
auto_pr = "never"        # Automatic PR creation (usually kept restrictive)
```

**Granular Controls:**
```toml
[permissions.git]
add_files = "ask"        # Stage files
create_branches = "ask"  # Create new branches
merge_branches = "never" # Merge operations (high-impact)
```

### Multi-Developer Repository Support

#### Passive Mode Operation
- **Non-intrusive**: System won't interfere with developers who don't use it
- **Change detection**: Monitors external changes without disrupting workflow
- **Smart suggestions**: Offers ADR creation for detected architectural decisions

#### External Change Detection
```bash
# Daily workflow for team environments
./adr-helper.sh scan     # Check for new branches and commits by others
./adr-helper.sh suggest  # AI analysis of potential decisions in recent commits
```

**Example scan output:**
```
üîç Scanning for external changes...
üìä External Change Summary:

  ‚Ä¢ New branch: feat/payment-gateway by alice@company.com
  ‚Ä¢ New branch: arch/microservices by bob@company.com

üí° Suggestions:
  ‚Ä¢ Consider creating ADR for payment gateway decision
  ‚Ä¢ Consider creating ADR for microservices architecture choice
```

#### Team Configuration
```bash
# One-time setup for team repositories
./adr-helper.sh team-setup
```

This configures:
- Appropriate permission levels based on team size
- External change tracking preferences
- Passive mode for non-disruptive operation
- Branch monitoring patterns

### Safety-First Design

#### Safe Mode
```bash
./adr-helper.sh safe-mode
```

Enables maximum safety settings:
- All git operations require explicit permission
- No automatic commits or pushes
- Passive mode enabled for team compatibility
- External change tracking without interference

#### Permission-Aware AI Operations
AI assistants automatically:
- Check permission settings before suggesting operations
- Respect "never" settings completely
- Request explicit permission for "ask" settings
- Inform users about "yes" operations before executing

### Quick Setup for Different Environments

#### Personal Project (Relaxed permissions)
```bash
./adr-helper.sh permissions
# Set: use_git="yes", auto_commit="ask"
```

#### Small Team (Moderate permissions)
```bash
./adr-helper.sh team-setup
# Choose: small team, enable external tracking
```

#### Large Organization (Strict permissions)
```bash
./adr-helper.sh safe-mode
# Maximum security and team compatibility
```

## Common Objections & Responses

**"We don't have time for more documentation"**

You don't have time NOT to do this. How much time do you waste explaining past decisions?

**"Our codebase is too small/simple"**

Perfect time to start. It scales with your project and prevents future complexity.

**"We use [other documentation system]"**

This complements existing docs. It's specifically for decisions, not general documentation.

**"What if people don't maintain it?"**

The helper scripts make it trivial. Plus, AI assistants will remind you when decisions aren't documented.

**"Will this interfere with my team's workflow?"**

No! The system operates in passive mode by default. Non-users are completely unaffected, while users get enhanced context and decision tracking.

**"I'm worried about unauthorized git operations"**

The authorization framework prevents this. Every operation respects your permission settings, defaulting to "ask" for safety. You can even set "never" for operations you don't want.

**"How do I know what my teammates are working on?"**

The external change detection automatically scans for new branches and commits by others, suggesting relevant ADRs without interfering with their work.

**"Not another documentation tool!"**

This isn't a tool - it's a pattern. No installation, no dependencies, no learning curve. Your AI assistant does all the work using simple markdown files that git already tracks. If you can use git and talk to an AI, you can use this.

**"What's the actual time savings?"**

- **Per "why did we..." question**: Save 30-120 minutes
- **Per new team member onboarding**: Save 2-4 hours  
- **Per architectural review**: Save 4-8 hours
- **Break-even**: After just 2-3 decisions

## üîÑ Session Continuity & Team Handoffs

Effective context management across sessions and team members prevents knowledge loss and reduces ramp-up time.

### AI-to-AI Session Handoffs

When continuing work across AI assistant sessions:

1. **Start with SESSION-CONTEXT.md** (if present) for immediate orientation
2. **Check recent git commits** for work completed since last session
3. **Review pending ADRs** in `branches/` that may need completion
4. **Scan adr-index.toml** for any new decisions or status changes
5. **Update SESSION-CONTEXT.md** with new status before ending session

**Handoff Quality Checklist:**
- [ ] Current status clearly documented
- [ ] Next actions explicitly stated
- [ ] Any blockers or open questions noted
- [ ] Relevant context links provided

### Human Team Member Handoffs

When transferring work between team members:

1. **Complete in-progress ADRs** or clearly mark them as pending with context
2. **Update project documentation** in `docs/` with current architectural state
3. **Document open questions** and decision points in SESSION-CONTEXT.md
4. **Provide context links** to relevant background ADRs and documentation
5. **Schedule handoff discussion** if complex context exists

**Team Handoff Template:**
```markdown
## Handoff Summary
**From:** [Previous team member]
**To:** [New team member]
**Date:** [Handoff date]

### Current Status

### Session Management Success Indicators

**Week 1:**
- SESSION-CONTEXT.md created and used daily
- AI assistants consistently start sessions by reading SESSION-CONTEXT.md
- Clear handoff notes between sessions

**Month 1:**
- Team members can orient to project state in under 5 minutes
- No repeated questions about recent decisions or current status
- Smooth handoffs between team members and AI sessions

**Month 3:**
- File organization scales cleanly with project growth
- Context maintenance becomes routine habit

## üîß Context Maintenance Protocols

Systematic maintenance prevents context drift and ensures the system remains valuable over time.

### Daily Maintenance (AI Assistant)
- **Update SESSION-CONTEXT.md** with current status after significant work
- **Complete ADRs** for any architectural decisions made during the session
- **Link new decisions** to existing context and related ADRs
- **Note blockers or questions** that need human input

### Weekly Maintenance (Human or AI)
- **Review SESSION-CONTEXT.md** for accuracy and relevance
- **Archive completed tasks** and resolved issues
- **Update next week's priorities** based on current progress
- **Check for stale links** or outdated references

### Monthly Maintenance (Human)
- **File organization review**: Move old content to appropriate archive locations
- **Documentation cleanup**: Remove or update outdated information
- **ADR relationship review**: Ensure decision dependencies are properly linked
- **System update check**: Review Claude Context System for improvements
- **Team process evaluation**: Assess what's working and what needs adjustment

### Quarterly Maintenance (Project Lead)
- **Comprehensive context audit**: Full review of all documentation for accuracy
- **Architecture documentation update**: Ensure high-level docs reflect current reality
- **Team training refresh**: Update team on best practices and new patterns
- **Tool evaluation**: Assess if additional tools or improvements are needed
- **Process optimization**: Refine workflows based on quarterly experience

### Maintenance Quality Indicators

**Good Context Health:**
- SESSION-CONTEXT.md is current (updated within last week)
- ADRs are complete and properly linked
- Supporting documentation is organized and findable
- Team members can orient quickly from context files
- No duplicate or conflicting information

**Context Needs Attention:**
- SESSION-CONTEXT.md is stale (not updated in 2+ weeks)
- Multiple incomplete or orphaned ADRs
- Scattered documentation in root directory
- Team members asking repeated questions about decisions
- Conflicting information in different files

### Emergency Context Recovery

If context becomes severely fragmented or outdated:

1. **Preserve existing content**: Move everything to `archive/emergency-backup-[date]/`
2. **Start fresh with core files**: Create new SESSION-CONTEXT.md and update adr-index.toml
3. **Gradually restore**: Move back only actively needed documentation
4. **Document lessons learned**: Create ADR about what went wrong and how to prevent it
5. **Implement stricter maintenance**: Increase review frequency temporarily

## Troubleshooting

**Remember: Your AI assistant should handle most maintenance automatically. If you're manually debugging TOML files or running complex commands, ask your AI to help instead.**

### Common Issues

**ADR validation fails**

```
# Make script executable
chmod +x .claude/adr-helper.sh

# Check file paths in index
./.claude/adr-helper.sh validate
```

**Missing ADR files**

```
# List what should exist vs what does
./.claude/adr-helper.sh status
find .claude/branches -name "*.md"
```

**TOML syntax errors**

```
# Validate TOML syntax (if you have a TOML parser)
python3 -c "import tomllib; tomllib.load(open('.claude/adr-index.toml', 'rb'))"
```

### Emergency Recovery

```
# If index is corrupted
cp .claude/adr-index.toml .claude/adr-index.toml.backup

# Find all ADRs
find .claude -name "*.md" -type f

# Validate structure
./.claude/adr-helper.sh validate 2>&1 | grep "ERROR"
```

### When Things Go Wrong

**AI created wrong ADR?** Just delete the file and ask again - it's just a markdown file

**TOML corrupted?** Run: `./adr-helper.sh validate` - it will tell you what's wrong

**Lost track of decisions?** Run: `./adr-helper.sh scan` - finds all ADRs in your project

**Permission issues?** Run: `./adr-helper.sh safe-mode` - resets to safe defaults

Remember: Everything is just text files. Worst case, you can read and edit them manually. No databases, no proprietary formats, no vendor lock-in.

## Customization for Different Teams

### Small Teams (2-5 people)

- Use fewer categories (just `feat/` and `arch/`)
- Simpler ADR template
- Less formal approval process

### Large Teams (10+ people)

- More detailed templates
- Formal review process
- Integration with issue tracking
- Regular ADR review meetings

### Different Technology Stacks

- **Frontend**: Add UI/UX decision categories
- **Backend**: Focus on data architecture, API design
- **DevOps**: Emphasize deployment, monitoring decisions
- **Product**: Include feature prioritization, user research

## Advanced Features

### ADR Relationships

Track how decisions relate to each other:

```
[relationships.depends_on]
"new-feature" = ["api-architecture", "database-choice"]

[relationships.conflicts_with]
"microservices" = ["monolith-architecture"]

[relationships.supersedes]
"api-v2" = ["api-v1"]
```

### Status Tracking

```
"decision-name" = {
    status = "proposed" | "accepted" | "superseded" | "rejected",
    superseded_by = "new-decision-id",
    # ...
}
```

### Integration with CI/CD

```
# .github/workflows/adr-validation.yml
name: ADR Validation
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  validate-adrs:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Validate ADRs
        run: ./.claude/adr-helper.sh validate
```

## Document Migration and Cleanup

### Automatic Organization

The system includes tools to handle existing documentation:

```bash
# Organize directory structure
./adr-helper.sh organize

# Clean up and organize existing docs
./adr-helper.sh cleanup
```

The `cleanup` command will:
- Move project-specific docs to `docs/` subdirectory
- Identify and optionally remove redundant files
- Create explanatory documentation for the new structure
- Preserve all valuable content in appropriate locations

### Manual Organization Guidelines

**If you have existing documentation:**

1. **ADR-like documents** ‚Üí Move to appropriate `branches/` category
2. **Project context/overview** ‚Üí Move to `docs/project-context.md`
3. **Setup/guide documents** ‚Üí Move to `docs/` with descriptive names
4. **Redundant system guides** ‚Üí Consider removing if superseded
5. **Reference materials** ‚Üí Keep in `docs/` with clear names

**Document naming conventions:**
- ADRs: `kebab-case-description.md` in appropriate `branches/` category
- Supporting docs: `DESCRIPTIVE-NAME.md` in `docs/` subdirectory
- Avoid generic names like `README.md` in favor of specific purposes

## Migrating from Existing Documentation

Already have documentation? Here's how to integrate it:

**From wikis**: Export as markdown, place in `.claude/docs/`
**From README sections**: Extract architectural decisions into ADRs using `./adr-helper.sh new arch "decision-name"`
**From code comments**: Ask your AI to "extract architectural decisions from our codebase comments into ADRs"
**From Confluence/Notion**: Export as markdown, organize into appropriate directories

Your AI assistant can help automate this migration - just ask!

**This system scales from small teams to large organizations with built-in safety and team collaboration features. Start simple and evolve based on your team's needs.**

_"In 6 months, you'll either have a well-documented decision history with seamless team collaboration, or you'll wish you did."_

## Real Usage Example

> "Our team adopted this after losing 3 days to 'why did we choose Kubernetes over ECS?' - nobody remembered the trade-offs we evaluated. Now every architectural decision is captured automatically as we make it. Last month a new developer found and understood our entire architecture history in 15 minutes. The ROI was immediate." - Engineering Team Lead, 50-person startup

## Live Simulation Demo

**Want to see the system in action?** We ran an automated simulation where the Claude Context System documented its own development decisions using real git workflows.

**Note**: The live simulation artifacts exist in this local repository in the `.claude/` directory and feature branches. The simulation demonstrates real ADRs, git history, and working helper scripts.

### üéØ What We Simulated
- **5 realistic development branches** with different decision types
- **Real architectural choices** the system faced during development
- **Complete git workflow** showing branch-per-decision pattern
- **Actual ADR generation** with context, alternatives, and consequences

### üìä Explore the Live Simulation

If you're in the local repository, you can explore the actual simulation artifacts:

```bash
# See the decision timeline across branches
git log --oneline --graph --all

# Explore the ADR structure
ls .claude/branches/
# arch/     - Architecture decisions
# feat/     - Feature implementation decisions  
# docs/     - Documentation strategy decisions
# chore/    - Process improvement decisions

# Check system status
./.claude/adr-helper.sh status
# ‚úì System initialized
#   feat: 2 ADRs, arch: 1 ADRs, docs: 1 ADRs, chore: 1 ADRs

# Read a real ADR
cat .claude/branches/arch/single-file-approach.md
```

### üìã Real ADRs Created
- **single-file-approach**: Why distribute as one self-contained file
- **ai-first-messaging**: How to communicate the AI-managed concept
- **team-permission-model**: Three-tier safety system for shared repos
- **configurable-update-frequencies**: Per-item maintenance schedules
- **v1-public-release-readiness**: Consolidating features for launch

### üí° Key Insights Proven
1. **Natural git integration** - Feels like normal development workflow
2. **Rich decision context** - Each ADR captures real trade-offs and reasoning
3. **AI-parseable structure** - Perfect for AI assistant consumption
4. **Team workflow compatibility** - Works with existing code review processes
5. **Self-documenting evolution** - The system documented its own creation

**The system just proved itself by managing its own architectural decisions. That's meta, practical, and pretty powerful.**

*Want to run your own simulation? Copy this document to your project as `.claude/CLAUDE-CONTEXT-SYSTEM.md` and ask your AI assistant to set up the system - then make some architectural decisions and watch it capture them automatically.*

## Time Savings Calculator

Calculate your potential time savings:

**Per Incident:**
- "Why did we choose X?" question: **Save 30-120 minutes**
- Debugging architectural issue: **Save 1-4 hours**
- Code review with missing context: **Save 30-60 minutes**

**Per Person:**
- New team member onboarding: **Save 2-4 hours**
- Returning to old project: **Save 1-2 hours**
- Cross-team collaboration: **Save 1-3 hours per project**

**Per Team:**
- Architectural review meeting: **Save 4-8 hours**
- Technical debt assessment: **Save 8-16 hours**
- Post-mortem with full context: **Save 2-4 hours**

**Break-even Point:** After just 2-3 "why did we..." questions, the system has paid for itself.

**Example ROI:** A 10-person team with 2 architectural decisions per month saves approximately 20-40 hours monthly - that's $2,000-$6,000 in developer time.

## üîÑ Staying Updated

This system is continuously improved. The canonical version at https://github.com/joshrotenberg/claude-context-system receives regular enhancements from real-world usage across multiple projects.

**Configurable Update Frequency**: Set your preferred update frequency in `.claude/adr-index.toml` (never, quarterly, monthly, weekly, or daily) and ask your AI assistant to check for improvements accordingly.

For questions or improvements, reference this system in your AI assistant conversations - it's designed to be self-documenting and self-improving.

## ‚úÖ Setup Validation Checklist
