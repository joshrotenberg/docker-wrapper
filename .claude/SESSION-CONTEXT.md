- Documentation tests: All examples verified
- Performance tests: Benchmarked and optimized

## CI/CD Requirements

### Essential CI Features Needed:
1. **Multi-platform testing** (Linux, macOS, Windows)
2. **Docker daemon integration** for integration tests
3. **Automated security auditing** with cargo-audit
4. **Code coverage reporting** with tarpaulin
5. **Automated documentation deployment** to docs.rs
6. **Automated crates.io publishing** on releases

### Testing Strategy:
- Unit tests run on all platforms without Docker
- Integration tests run on Linux with Docker daemon
- Examples tested for compilation on all platforms
- Performance benchmarks on stable environment

## Next Actions - 70% Coverage Strategy
