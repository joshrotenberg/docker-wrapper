# ADR: Publication and Release Strategy

**Status**: Accepted
**Date**: 2025-07-24
**Author**: Development Team
**Tags**: [docs, publication, release, crates-io, community, strategy]

## Context

The docker-wrapper project has reached production readiness and requires a comprehensive strategy for publishing to crates.io and building community adoption. Without a structured approach to publication and release management, the project risks inconsistent releases, poor community engagement, and missed opportunities for ecosystem adoption.

The project needs to transition from development to a publicly maintained open-source library with proper release automation, community engagement, and long-term sustainability planning.

## Decision

We establish a comprehensive publication and release strategy that includes:

1. **Automated Release Management**: Use release-please for semantic versioning and changelog generation
2. **Multi-Stage Publication Process**: Gradual rollout with quality gates
3. **Community Building Strategy**: Documentation, examples, and engagement plan
4. **Long-term Maintenance Plan**: Sustainability and ecosystem integration

### Publication Roadmap

#### Phase 1: Pre-Publication (Quality Gates)
- [ ] All tests pass (`cargo test --all-features`)
- [ ] Clippy lints clean (`cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`)
- [ ] Code formatted (`cargo fmt -- --check`)
- [ ] Documentation builds without warnings (`cargo doc --all-features`)
- [ ] Security audit clean (`cargo audit`)
- [ ] MSRV compatibility verified (Rust 1.70+)
- [ ] Comprehensive README.md with compelling value proposition
- [ ] All public APIs documented with rustdoc
- [ ] Working examples demonstrating key features
- [ ] CHANGELOG.md following Keep a Changelog format
- [ ] CONTRIBUTING.md with clear guidelines
- [ ] Dual MIT/Apache-2.0 licensing

#### Phase 2: Initial Publication
- [ ] Cargo.toml metadata complete and accurate
- [ ] Version 0.1.0 following semantic versioning
- [ ] Relevant keywords and categories
- [ ] Repository and documentation URLs correct
- [ ] Minimal, well-justified dependencies
- [ ] Initial crates.io publication
- [ ] Documentation deployment to docs.rs
- [ ] GitHub repository optimization

#### Phase 3: Community Building
- [ ] Comprehensive examples in multiple scenarios
- [ ] Integration guides for common use cases
- [ ] Performance benchmarks and comparisons
- [ ] Community communication channels
- [ ] Contributor onboarding materials
- [ ] Issue and PR templates
- [ ] Security vulnerability reporting process

#### Phase 4: Ecosystem Integration
- [ ] Integration with popular Rust frameworks
- [ ] Plugin/extension system design
- [ ] Performance optimization based on real usage
- [ ] Advanced monitoring and observability features
- [ ] Enterprise-ready features and support

### Release Automation Strategy

**Primary Tool**: release-please for automated semantic versioning
- Automated changelog generation from conventional commits
- Version bumping based on commit types (feat, fix, breaking)
- GitHub Releases with proper release notes
- Automated crates.io publishing on release

**Release Cadence**:
- Patch releases: As needed for bug fixes
- Minor releases: Monthly for new features
- Major releases: Quarterly or for breaking changes

### Community Engagement Plan

1. **Documentation First**: Comprehensive, example-rich documentation
2. **Real-World Examples**: Practical use cases and integration patterns
3. **Performance Focus**: Benchmarks and optimization guidance
4. **Developer Experience**: Ergonomic APIs and helpful error messages
5. **Ecosystem Integration**: Work with other Rust Docker tools for compatibility

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
- Structured, predictable release process reduces maintenance burden
- Automated tooling ensures consistency and reduces human error
- Community-focused approach increases adoption potential
- Quality gates maintain high standards throughout project lifecycle
- Clear documentation and examples reduce support burden

### Negative Consequences
- Initial setup overhead for release automation
- Commitment to maintaining compatibility and support
- Need for ongoing community engagement and maintenance
- Dependency on external services (crates.io, docs.rs, GitHub)

### Risks
- Market timing - other solutions may emerge during publication process
- Community adoption may be slower than expected
- Maintenance burden may exceed available resources
- Breaking changes in Docker CLI could require major refactoring

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Manual Release Process
- **Description**: Manual version bumping, changelog maintenance, and publishing
- **Pros**: Full control, no automation dependencies
- **Cons**: Error-prone, time-consuming, inconsistent
- **Why rejected**: Doesn't scale and increases maintenance burden

### Alternative 2: Minimal Publication Strategy
- **Description**: Basic crates.io publication with minimal documentation
- **Pros**: Faster initial publication, less initial work
- **Cons**: Poor adoption potential, higher support burden
- **Why rejected**: Undermines project goals of becoming premier Docker library

### Alternative 3: Enterprise-First Strategy
- **Description**: Focus on enterprise features and support from day one
- **Pros**: Potential revenue, enterprise adoption
- **Cons**: Limits open-source community, increases complexity
- **Why rejected**: Want to establish open-source community first

## Implementation Notes

### Immediate Actions (0.1.0 Release)
1. Set up release-please configuration
2. Complete final documentation review
3. Verify all quality gates pass
4. Execute initial crates.io publication
5. Set up GitHub repository for community engagement

### Short-term (First Quarter)
1. Monitor community feedback and address issues
2. Publish additional examples and integration guides
3. Establish regular release cadence
4. Begin ecosystem integration conversations

### Long-term (First Year)
1. Evaluate performance and optimization opportunities
2. Consider advanced features based on community feedback
3. Explore enterprise support options
4. Plan major version releases for significant improvements
