## How We Work

### Command Implementation Process
1. **Research**: Run `docker help <command>` to understand all options
2. **Branch**: Create feature branch: `feature/<command>`
3. **Design**: Create extensible trait-based architecture allowing custom options
4. **Implement**: Focus on required + common optional, but allow any option via trait
5. **Test**: Unit tests + command-specific integration tests + documentation tests
6. **Quality**: Zero clippy warnings, proper formatting, comprehensive docs
7. **CI**: Fix all CI issues immediately - clippy, MSRV, test failures
8. **PR**: Create PR with `gh pr create`, simple description, no emojis
9. **Chain**: Next command branches off previous for sequential development

### Extensible Command Architecture
All commands derive from a base trait that allows:
- Core required options (implemented directly)
- Common optional options (implemented directly) 
- Any unimplemented option via `.arg()` or `.option()` methods
- Type-safe builder pattern with escape hatch for advanced usage

### Conventional Naming
- **Branches**: `feature/<command>`
- **Commits**: `feat(<command>): implement core functionality`  
- **PRs**: `feat(<command>): implement docker <command> command`
- **Integration Tests**: `tests/<command>_integration.rs` per command
- **Main Integration**: `tests/integration_tests.rs` for cross-command tests

### PR Management
- Each command gets its own PR for focused review
- Next command branches off previous (not main) for sequential development
- PR descriptions: command implemented, key details, 1-2 short examples
- Use `gh pr create` for consistency

## Implementation Rules

### Per Command Branch:
1. **Full Implementation**: Support all core/obvious options for the command
2. **Complete Testing**: Unit tests + integration tests where applicable
3. **Full Documentation**: Rustdoc + examples
4. **Lint Clean**: `cargo clippy` and `cargo fmt` before commit
5. **Single Focus**: Only implement the target command

### Prerequisites Handling:
- Use `tokio::process::Command` directly for any needed commands not yet implemented
- Mark with `// TODO: Replace with our implementation when available`
- Focus on the current command only

### Core Options Definition:
Focus on the most commonly used and important options, not every possible flag.

## Current Status
- **Active Branch**: `feature/login` ✅ **COMPLETE - ALL 3 NATIVE OPTIONS**
- **Next Branch**: `feature/logout` (branches off feature/login)
- **Total Commands**: 14  
- **Completed**: 10/14 (prerequisites, run, exec, ps, build, bake, pull, push, images, login)

## Development Workflow

### Starting a New Command:
1. Create branch: `git checkout -b feature/{command}`
2. Implement command with core options using async-trait
3. Write comprehensive unit tests
4. Write command-specific integration tests (`tests/{command}_integration.rs`)
5. Write full documentation with examples
6. Run `cargo clippy` and `cargo fmt` locally
7. Commit, push, and monitor CI immediately
8. Fix any CI failures (tests, clippy, fmt, MSRV) before continuing
9. Pause for review when ALL CI checks are green

### Branch Naming:
- `prerequisites` - Docker detection and validation ✅
- `feature/run` - docker run command ✅
- `feature/exec` - docker exec command ✅
- `feature/ps` - docker ps command ✅
- `feature/build` - docker build command ✅
- etc.

### Testing Strategy:
- **Unit Tests**: Command construction, argument parsing, error handling (in src/)
- **Integration Tests**: 
  - `tests/integration_tests.rs` - Cross-command and general tests
  - `tests/{command}_integration.rs` - Command-specific integration tests
  - All integration tests gracefully handle Docker unavailability
- **Documentation Tests**: Ensure examples in docs compile and work

## Open Questions Per Command

### Prerequisites (COMPLETE)
- No open questions - fully resolved

### Logout Command (NEXT - IN PROGRESS)
- Questions will be added as we encounter them during implementation

**Future Enhancement Ideas:**
- **Docker Binary Detection Enhancement**: Instead of relying only on `which docker`, check common Docker installation paths (e.g., `/usr/bin/docker`, `/usr/local/bin/docker`, `/opt/docker/bin/docker`, `C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\resources\bin\docker.exe` on Windows) and allow specifying explicit Docker binary location via environment variable (e.g., `DOCKER_BINARY_PATH`) or command argument

## Current Process Standards:
- Centralized error handling via `src/error.rs`
- Conventional commits/branches/PRs
- Sequential PR chain (branch off previous, not main)
- Research-driven implementation (`docker help <command>`)
- Extensible trait architecture for all commands
- Commit, push, monitor CI, fix failures immediately
- Professional documentation (minimal emoji usage)
- Document open questions per command for later resolution

---
**Current Focus**: Login command ✅ COMPLETE - All 3 native Docker login options implemented!
**Status**: Process Correction Applied - Proper One-Command-Per-Branch Development, Ready for Logout Command

## Process Improvements Validated:
1. **Complete Native Support**: Supporting ALL options (not just common) creates revolutionary implementations
2. **Research-First Approach**: `docker help <command>` + modern option discovery is highly effective
3. **Refined Process**: Quality gates and CI monitoring make complex implementations smooth
4. **Test Organization**: Command-specific integration tests work excellently
5. **Quality Standards**: Zero clippy warnings + all CI passing is the right bar
6. **Code Organization**: Helper methods enable maintainable large implementations
7. **One-Command-Per-Branch**: Proper sequential development prevents implementation chaos and ensures focused PRs

## Process Speed & Quality Improvement:
- **Run Command**: Multiple iterations, CI failures, learning curve
- **Exec Command**: Single smooth implementation, no CI issues, complete success
- **PS Command**: Continued smooth execution, smart output parsing added
- **Build Command**: Revolutionary 1500+ line implementation, ALL options, still smooth
- **Images/Login Commands**: Process correction applied - proper branching restored efficiency
- **Key Factor**: Process refinement + proper branching enables handling the most complex Docker commands

## Future Refactoring Notes:
- **File Organization**: Consider moving to `src/command/` directory structure:
  - `src/command/mod.rs` - Core command traits and utilities
  - `src/command/run.rs` - Run command implementation
  - `src/command/exec.rs` - Exec command implementation
  - `src/command/ps.rs` - PS command implementation
  - `src/command/build.rs` - Build command implementation (1500+ lines!)
  - This would provide better organization as we scale to 14+ commands
  - **Timeline**: After completing current command push, before 1.0 release
  - **Priority**: Higher now due to build.rs size and overall codebase growth
