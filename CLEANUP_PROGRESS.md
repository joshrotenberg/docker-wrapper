### Key Metrics
- **Total Commands**: 14/14 (100% complete)
- **Commands with 100% Option Coverage**: 12/13 (92%)
- **Unit Tests**: 185 tests (all passing)
- **Integration Tests**: 10+ test suites (all passing)
- **Clippy Warnings**: 0 (clean code)
- **Documentation Coverage**: 100% (comprehensive)

## ðŸ“‹ Systematic Cleanup Plan Progress

### Phase 1: Code Organization & Structure (COMPLETE)
**Status**: COMPLETE - Merged in PR #26

**Achievements**:
- Implemented modern Rust module structure (`command.rs` + `command/` directory)
- Moved all 13 command files to organized directory structure
- Updated all import paths throughout codebase (commands, tests, examples)
- Maintained 100% test coverage (185 unit + integration tests)
- Zero clippy warnings maintained
- All examples and documentation updated

**Impact**:
- **Maintainability**: Significantly improved code organization
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new commands without cluttering
- **Standards**: Follows modern Rust ecosystem conventions
- **Developer Experience**: Better IDE navigation and understanding

### Phase 2: Code Quality & Standards (READY TO START)
**Status**: READY - Prerequisites completed

**Planned Tasks**:
1. **Missing Integration Tests**: Add comprehensive integration tests for remaining commands
   - `tests/build_integration.rs` - Build command integration tests
   - `tests/logout_integration.rs` - Logout command integration tests  
   - `tests/version_integration.rs` - Version command integration tests
   - `tests/info_integration.rs` - Info command integration tests

2. **Code Quality Improvements**: Systematic review across all commands
   - Consistent error message formatting
   - Documentation improvements where needed
   - Performance optimizations where applicable

3. **Standards Consistency**: Ensure uniform patterns across all commands
   - Consistent builder patterns
   - Uniform test organization
   - Consistent documentation styles

### Phase 3: Feature Completeness Analysis (PLANNED)
**Status**: PLANNED - Gap analysis completed

**Key Finding**: 
- **12/13 commands have 100% option coverage** - exceptional achievement!
- **1 command (run) has 9.4% coverage** - identified for potential enhancement

**Planned Tasks**:
1. **Run Command Enhancement**: Address the single coverage gap
   - High-priority options: `--memory`, `--cpus`, `--restart`, `--user`, `--privileged`
   - Medium-priority options: `--network`, `--hostname`, `--health-*`
   - Maintain backward compatibility with current API

2. **Unimplemented Options Documentation**: 
   - Create comprehensive documentation of available vs implemented options
   - Priority-based recommendations for future enhancements
   - Clear guidance on using escape hatches for missing options

### Phase 4: CI & Documentation (PLANNED)
**Status**: PLANNED - Infrastructure ready

**Planned Tasks**:
1. **CI Enhancements**: 
   - Fix any remaining CI issues across platforms
   - Ensure 100% CI pass rate for all PRs
   - Performance benchmarking integration

2. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Update README with all 14 commands
   - Complete API documentation review
   - Add more usage examples and tutorials

### Phase 5: Release Preparation (PLANNED)
**Status**: PLANNED - Foundation solid

**Planned Tasks**:
1. **Performance & Optimization**: Final optimizations
   - Memory usage analysis and optimization
   - Command execution performance tuning
   - Binary size optimization

2. **Release Readiness**: Prepare for 1.0 release
   - Version bump and comprehensive changelog
   - Final quality gate validation
   - Release artifacts and documentation

## Current Priorities

### Immediate Next Steps (Post-Phase 1)
1. **Decide on Run Command**: Should we enhance the run command to 100% coverage before continuing?
2. **Phase 2 Execution**: Begin missing integration tests and code quality improvements
3. **CI Monitoring**: Ensure all current functionality remains stable

### Strategic Decision Point: Run Command Enhancement

**The Question**: Should we achieve 100% coverage on all 14 commands by enhancing the run command?

**Arguments For**:
- Psychological satisfaction of 100% completion across all commands
- The run command is the most commonly used Docker command
- High-priority missing options (memory, cpus, restart) are production-essential

**Arguments Against**:
- Current 9.4% coverage includes the most essential options
- Escape hatch architecture means no users are blocked
- Other phases might provide more value
- Feature creep risk

**Recommendation**: Complete current cleanup phases first, then reassess run command enhancement based on user feedback and priorities.

## Success Metrics

### Current State
- **185 unit tests** passing consistently
- **0 clippy warnings** - clean, idiomatic code
- **Comprehensive integration tests** across all commands
- **Modern module structure** - maintainable and scalable
- **Complete documentation** - all commands documented

### Target State (Post-Cleanup)
- **200+ tests** with enhanced integration coverage
- **Production-ready reliability** across all commands
- **Optimized performance** for common use cases
- **1.0 release readiness** with comprehensive ecosystem
